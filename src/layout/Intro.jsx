        <p><b>tl;dr Scroll down and see what I created below.</b></p>
        <p>
          One idea I had for a small project was to redesign the student groups
          page of my schoolâ€™s &nbsp;
          <a href="https://asa.mit.edu/groups/">Association of Student Activities website</a>
          . The group page of the website serves to provide information about the
          hundreds of student groups on campus, info like name, status, 
          description, and meeting times.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see by either down below or the link above, the website is 
          very bland and outdated.  As an officer of one of the
          student groups, I would visit this page a couple of times a semester 
          and each time be turned off by the poor design and styling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew I could develop a much better designed page and so , I 
          decided that a cool project for me to tackle would be updating the 
          interface of the group page of the website.  I decided to use the 
          Material Design style for the update. Although there are many 
          Material Design libraries out there (MUI, Material Design Light, 
          Materialize), I chose to forgo using any of them and instead write 
          my own CSS and React components to control all the states, 
          animations, and functionality myself.  
        </p>
        <p>
          View my work below.  The first tab, Old, is a remake of the current 
          ASA group page.  I second tab, New, is my rendition of the website, 
          the updated version.  The third tab, is a side by side comparison of
          the two pages, with the zoom of half on each.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Because this was just a small project/the ASA website is unlikely 
          to be viewed on a mobile screen/I became lazy, I did not make the 
          page responsive.)
