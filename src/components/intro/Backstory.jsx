        One idea I had for a small project was to redesign the&nbsp;
        <a href="https://asa.mit.edu/groups/" target="_blank">Groups</a> page
        of my schoolâ€™s&nbsp; 
        <a href="https://asa.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Association of
        Student Activities</a>&nbsp;
        website. The Groups page provides details about the
        hundreds of student groups on campus, including each group's name, status, 
        description, and meeting times.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see by either looking down below or clicking the first link above,
        the website is very bland and outdated.  As an officer of one of the
        student groups, I would visit this page a couple of times a semester 
        and each time be turned off by the poor design and styling.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew I could design something better so, as a project, I
        decided to do just that and restyle the group page.  I decided to use 
        the Material Design style for the update. Although there are many 
        Material Design libraries out there (MUI, Material Design Light, 
        Materialize), I forwent using any of them and instead wrote 
        my own CSS and React components, giving myself control of all states, 
        animations, and functionality.

        View my work below.  The first tab, Old, is a remake of the current 
        ASA group page.  The second tab, New, is my rendition of the website, 
        the updated version.  The third tab, Both, is a side by side comparison of
        the two pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this was just a small project and did not bother making the web
        page design is not responsive.
      </p>
