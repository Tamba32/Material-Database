          <p>Hello incoming MIT students!</p>
          <p>
            Student activities play an important role in student life at MIT – they're a
            great place to meet people, practice old skills and learn new ones, have fun,
            and give back to the community.  Undergraduate and graduate students, along
            with other MIT community members, participate in more than 450 recognized
            activities and organizations.  Below is an overview of some of these student
            groups compiled by the 
            <a href="http://web.mit.edu/asa">Association of Student Activities (ASA)</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can't find a particular group or activity, remember that these are
            just some of the more than 450 groups recognized by the ASA.  You can also look
            at a current listing of activities on the 
            <a href="http://web.mit.edu/asa/resources/group-list.html">ASA website</a>.
            &nbsp;If you still can't find what you're looking for, then you can apply to
            <a href="http://web.mit.edu/asa/start/index.html">start your own group</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ASA also organizes an Activities Midway during Orientation with booths
            for more than 200 groups, lots of giveaways, and some performances.  The Midway
            is the afternoon of Friday, September 2 (2:30–4:30PM) in the Johnson Athletic Center.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can learn more about the ASA and MIT student activities in general on

          </p>
          <p>We look forward to seeing you in fall!</p>
