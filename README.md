## Material Design | MIT Student Group Database

One idea I had for a small project was to redesign the [Groups](https://asa.mit.edu/groups/) page of my schoolâ€™s [Association of Student Activities](https://asa.mit.edu/) website. The Groups page provides details about the hundreds of student groups on campus, including each group's name, status, description, and meeting times.

The current website is very bland and outdated. As an officer of one of the student groups, I would visit this page a couple of times a semester and each time be turned off by the poor design and styling.

I knew I could design something better so, as a project, I decided to do just that and restyle the group page. I decided to use the Material Design style for the update. Although there are many Material Design libraries out there (MUI, Material Design Light, Materialize), I forwent using any of them and instead wrote my own CSS and React components, giving myself control of all states, animations, and functionality.

View my work [here](https://tambamon.com/materialdb/). The first tab, Old, is a remake of the current ASA group page. The second tab, New, is my rendition of the website, the updated version. The third tab, Both, is a side by side comparison of the two pages.

Because this was just a small project, I did not bother making the web page responsive.

Thanks for stopping by.
